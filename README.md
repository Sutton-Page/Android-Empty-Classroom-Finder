# Empty Classroom finder app

## Project Description
While in unversity I found that enjoyed working in empty classrooms on campus but during the week I would have to check multiple classrooms to find an empty one to work in.
To solve this problem I created an Android app that would allow you to select any building on campus and a time frame and it would show you which classrooms in the building were empty.
