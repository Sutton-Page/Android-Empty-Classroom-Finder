# Empty Classroom finder app

## Project Description
While in university, I enjoyed working in empty classrooms on campus. However, during the week, I often had to check multiple rooms to find one available. To solve this problem, I developed an Android app that lets users select a campus building and a time frame to quickly see which classrooms are empty.

## Limitations
To obtain the course data, I had to manually collect and organize it since my university did not make the information easily accessible.
As a result, the app's data is currently outdated, but it still serves as a functional demonstration.
